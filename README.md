# Tweet-Rumor-Testing
This project demonstrates the process of classifying tweets into different categories (e.g., rumor, non-rumor, etc.) using machine learning techniques. The project involves the following steps:
1. Loading tweet data and corresponding labels.
2. Preprocessing the tweet text.
3. Vectorizing the text using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. Training a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluating the model with classification metrics and confusion matrix.
6. Displaying a random tweet with its true and predicted labels.
